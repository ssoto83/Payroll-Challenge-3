# Challenge 3: Employee Payroll Tracker

Modified starter code provided on Challenge 3, to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app runs in a browser. Added a While loop to the Collect Employees function to allow the user to enter first, last name and salary for each employee; with the option to continue to add employees or stop.

## The User Story
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
